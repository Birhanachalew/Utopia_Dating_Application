## üåç How Cultural and Event-Based Matching Works

### Cultural Value-Based Matching

EDA places Ethiopian culture at the heart of its matching process. When users register, they provide details about their ethnicity, language, religion, family values, and other cultural preferences. The matching algorithm uses this information to prioritize connections between users who share similar backgrounds and beliefs, increasing the likelihood of meaningful, lasting relationships that can lead to real marriage.

### Event-Based Matching

Beyond profiles, EDA integrates Ethiopian community and cultural events‚Äîsuch as holidays, festivals, and gatherings‚Äîinto the matching process. Users can express interest in specific events, and the platform helps connect people who plan to attend the same events or share enthusiasm for Ethiopian traditions. This makes it easier to meet like-minded individuals both online and in real-life settings.

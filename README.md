# EDA - Utopia Dating Application

## üíº Made by Birhan Aschalew

### EDA is a culturally-focused dating site designed to help Ethiopians find meaningful connections leading to real marriage.

## üéØ Project Goals

The main goal of EDA is to create a dating platform that prioritizes Ethiopian cultural values and traditions in the matching process. Unlike generic dating apps, EDA uses cultural compatibility and event-based matching to help users find partners who share similar backgrounds, beliefs, and life goals.

- **Cultural Value-Based Matching:**  
  Users provide information about their cultural background, values, and preferences. The matching algorithm prioritizes compatibility based on Ethiopian traditions, languages, and family values, ensuring that matches are more likely to lead to lasting relationships and marriage.

- **Event-Based Matching:**  
  EDA features community and cultural events (such as holidays, festivals, and gatherings) as part of the matching process. Users can connect based on shared interests in specific events, making it easier to meet like-minded individuals in real-life settings.

- **Real-Time Experience:**  
  The site works in real time, so updates and interactions happen instantly without needing to refresh the page.

- **Scalable & Modern:**  
  Built using Node.js, Express, React, Redux, and PostgreSQL, with Docker for easy setup, EDA is designed to support a large user base and provide a seamless experience.

## üåç How Cultural and Event-Based Matching Works

### Cultural Value-Based Matching

EDA places Ethiopian culture at the heart of its matching process. When users register, they provide details about their ethnicity, language, religion, family values, and other cultural preferences. The matching algorithm uses this information to prioritize connections between users who share similar backgrounds and beliefs, increasing the likelihood of meaningful, lasting relationships that can lead to real marriage.

### Event-Based Matching

Beyond profiles, EDA integrates Ethiopian community and cultural events‚Äîsuch as holidays, festivals, and gatherings‚Äîinto the matching process. Users can express interest in specific events, and the platform helps connect people who plan to attend the same events or share enthusiasm for Ethiopian traditions. This makes it easier to meet like-minded individuals both online and in real-life settings.
